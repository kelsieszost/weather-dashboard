# weather-dashboard

## Description
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my skill level with HTML/CSS/Javascript/APIS from in class activities. This site functions as a weather dashboard that is searchable by city. Upon search, current weather and the five day forecast for the queried city will render. The application will locally store 5 cities. The cities stored are converted into buttons so the user can easily select locations from their search history.
